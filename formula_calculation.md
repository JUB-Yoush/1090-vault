- An ordered sequence of [[well_formed_formula]] that show complex [[string]] being formed piece by piece, with each new string adding a new part to the formula.
## Formula Calculation Rules:
1. you can add any new [[boolean_variable]] or constant ( vars must be written in () but const don't)
2. you can negate any existing boolean var or const $(\neg A)$
3. you can add a [[boolean_alphabet#Boolean Connectives|connective]] between any existing [[boolean_variable]] or const $(A \lor B)$
4. (bonus when dealing with [[predicate_logic]]) you can write (($\forall x$) $A$) if $A$ had already been written
Example:
$p,q,(\neg q),(p \land (\neg q))$
