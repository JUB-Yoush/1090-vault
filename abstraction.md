#PREDICATE_LOGIC 
- abstractions of formula convert groupings of subformulae into fresh boolean symbols
- Example: $x=y \lor \neg x=y$ 
- the abstraction takes the $(x=y)$ and turns it into a fresh variable
- abstraction is $p \lor \neg p$
- you can abstract predicate logic back into a boolean logic form and use our knowledge to prove tautological implications
