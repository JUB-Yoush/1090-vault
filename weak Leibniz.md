- if $\vdash A \equiv B$, then $\vdash C[p\textbackslash A]\equiv C[p\textbackslash B]$  
	- what does this mean: if $A$ and $B$ are equivalent, then we can use [[unconditional_substituion]] to substitute $A$ and $B$ into the same formula $C$ and find that both formula are Equivalent
- Corollary: if $\Gamma \vdash A \equiv B$ and none of the bound variables of C occur free in formulae of $\Gamma$, then $\Gamma \vdash C[p \backslash A] \equiv C[p \backslash B]$
