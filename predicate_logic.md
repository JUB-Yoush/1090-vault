#TODO 
- boolean logic is totally insufficient. it can't handle objects like numbers, sets, strings, etc.

### Logical symbols (fixed part of the alphabet)
- Boolean Alphabet, ie Boolean Variables, Boolean Constants, brackets, and Boolean connectives
- Object Variables: x,y,z,u,v,w with or without primes or subscripts
- symbol for equality of objects: =
- the universal quantifier symbol: $\forall$

### non logical symbols
- Zero or more object constants 1, 1000, {1},{1,2,3},{}, denoted as a,b,c
- Zero or more functions: + - $\cup$ $\cap$ , denoted as f,g,h with or without primes of subscripts 
- Zero or more predicates: $>$, $\ge$, $\supset$
