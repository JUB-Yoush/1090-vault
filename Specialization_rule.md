#PREDICATE_LOGIC 
- metatheorem
- $(\forall x)A \vdash A[x:=t]$ 
- recall 1090's universal instantiation: if we have a universal quantifer over a formula then we can take an instance of a particular formula 
- we denote this rule using [[substitution]]
- an application of [[logical_axiom#First-Order Logic ($ Lambda_{1}$)|Ax2]]
- we can only apply this rule is the substitution is defined

Corollary $(\forall x)A\vdash A$  
- if $A$ exists in the universally quantified set, then it's true
