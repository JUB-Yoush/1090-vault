- if $A\rightarrow B$
- and $A$ is established to be true at some stage in a [[hilbert_style_proofs|hilbert style proofs]]
- sorta a part of the [[logical_axiom|logical axioms]], as the list she gave us is missing a lot of stuff
- then you can write $B$ as true in the proof
1. $A$ 
2. $A\rightarrow B$
3. $B$ MP(1,2)
