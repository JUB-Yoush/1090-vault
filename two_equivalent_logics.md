- Two "different Logics" are equivalent iff they have the same [[absolute_theorem|absolute theorems]] (and relative theorems)

### Logic_1
our logic with primary rules [[bolean_logic|BL]] and [[rules_of_inference#Equinimity|EQN]]

### Logic_2
Predicate logic with one primary rule [[modus_ponens]] 

Lemma: we can prove using modus ponens (logic 2) that post theorem holds for for finite $\Gamma$
