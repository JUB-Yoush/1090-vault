#PREDICATE_LOGIC 
#TODO 

- a variable in [[predicate_logic]] can be bound to a quantifier or free from it, depending on if it's in it's scope or not.
- Example: $B \rightarrow (\forall x) A$ 
- Any $x$ occurring in $A$ is in the scope of ($\forall x$) 
- Any $x$ occuring in $B$ is not in the scope of ($\forall x$)
