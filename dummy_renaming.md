#PREDICATE_LOGIC 
- if z does not occur in A (free nor bound), then $\vdash (\forall x)A \equiv[x:=z]$ 
- what does that mean: remember that x y and z are all just variables, we can change the symbols but maintain the meaning
- you can replace all the $x$'s in a formula with $z$'s and the formula will say the same thing, the replacement must be [[p_fresh|fresh]] however ($z$ can't already be in your formula)
- also works with $\exists$
