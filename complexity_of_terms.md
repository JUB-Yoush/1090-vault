#PREDICATE_LOGIC 
- the complexity of a term is defined to be the number of function symbols
- we will use $t$ and $s$ to denote terms
- the notation $f(t_{1}t_{2}...t_{n})$ refers to the [[arity]] of any function $f$
- we can define terms recursivley, as well as use [[top_down_parsing]] and [[bottom_up_parsing]]
