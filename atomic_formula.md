- [[formula_calculation]] of one [[boolean_variable]]

### Predicate logic
- in [[predicate_logic]] it's a little different 
	- it's any [[boolean_variable|boolean variable]] or [[boolean_alphabet#Boolean constants|boolean constant]]  
	- the [[string]] $s=t$ for any terms $t$ and $s$
	- the string $\psi t_{1}t_{2}...t_{n}$ for some predicate $\psi$ with [[arity]] n and terms $t_{1}t_{2}...t_{n}$ 
- [[complexity]] of the all these formulae is zero
