	Identify well-formed formulae and evaluate which are tautologies (truth tables,  
	semantics) in both propositional and predicate logic  
	➢ Apply axioms, rules of inference and theorems in formulating or constructing different  
	styles of mathematical proofs (e.g. Hilbert, Equational, Resolution) in both propositional  
	and predicate logic  
	➢ Differentiate between truth table techniques and proof techniques and be able to  
	deduce one from the other (soundness and completeness)  
	➢ Differentiate between valid and invalid statements  
	➢ Apply soundness theorem to disprove invalid statements  
	➢ Differentiate between weak and strong generalization
