## Equimnimity
## $\frac{A,A \equiv B}{B}$
- What it means: if we know that A is true and that A is equivalent to B, we can know that B is also true.

## Leibniz
## $\frac{A \equiv B}{C[\textbf{p}:=A] \equiv C[\textbf{p}:=B]}$

- What it means: Equivalnece is preseved after [[substitution]]. If we substitute equivalent formuas into a [[well_formed_formula]] then the eqivalence of the formula will be the same after both.
- if $A$ and $B$ are the same then substituting either into  a wff will give the same results
