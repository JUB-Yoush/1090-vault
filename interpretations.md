- an interpretations **D** = (D,M) translates a formula from $A$ to $A^D$ 
- there are two components of a first-order language interpretation:
	- Domain D (non empty set like the natural numbers)
	- Translator M (A mapping that maps every)

- Given an interpretation **D** = (D,M), the translation of A, i.e. $A^D)$ is obtained by
	- replacing $(\forall x)$ with $(\forall x \in D)$
