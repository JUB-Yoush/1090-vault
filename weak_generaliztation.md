- If $\Gamma \vdash A$ and $x$ does not occur free in any formula in the set $\Gamma$, then $\Gamma \vdash (\forall x)A$  
- what does that mean:
- proof by induction on length of $\Gamma -$ Proof of $A$ in [[two_equivalent_logics#Logic_2|Logic 2]] 

- Corollary: if $\vdash A$ then $\vdash(\forall x)A$
- to be able to generalize $A$, we must have a proof for $A$
- If $A$ is an assumption and not proven, we are not allowed to generalize
